        <p>It was about 2016 when I saw a programmer on Youtube
        how he recorded himself while he was coding.
        I always wanted to earn a living with something creative but be mentally challenging.
        As I watched how he coded this purple rain like animation with a JavaScript library
        called P5.JS, I was fascinated! I saw how he solved multiple problems
        on his way to get the creative output he wanted. I knew I wanted
        to learn to code. And now I want to earn a living with it!
